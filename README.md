![Slenderman - Sample](https://raw.github.com/tylergaw/slenderman/master/src/slenderman-sample.jpg)

## Requirements for contributing
- [http://glyphsapp.com/](Glyphs) or [http://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini/](Glyphs Mini) - I use Glyphs Mini because I'm a weekend warrior when it comes to typography.
- Adobe Illustrator (sorry). You might be able to use Sketch or another vector editor?
- Patience

## What's up with the Makefile?
I just use it to make a zip file for downloading. When I update Slenderman I don't
want to have to manually make the zip each time. Computers!

## What did I learn?
- (Glyphs specific) Components need special treatment before exporting. A component is a glyph that
is made up of other glyphs. Examples include the ellipsis; made of three periods,
right/left double quotes; made of right/left single quotes. Before exporting, open
each component glyph. In the Glyph Menu choose Decompose Component (shift+cmd+D).
- Making a font is real fucking hard.
- Making a font is real fucking satisfying.
